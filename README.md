# Allegro | Beautiful and Responsive
By Franceska Mackinson - Version 1.0GRV (GitHub Release Version)

Allegro is a beautiful responsive IPB 4 theme created for Webflake (webflake.sx) and is only officially uploaded to Webflake by the user "Erza", and to the official Allegro GitHub (Allegro Theme). If you see the theme uploaded elsewhere for download or even charged, please do not download those. Allegro is a free theme with clean edits, but requires patches when IPB4 is getting an update because of (necessary) modified theme files that are overwritten during an upgrade. The CSS however is 100% clean and is not overwritten during upgrades. 

# Permissions & Support 
You are free to modify the theme in custom.css to your liking, but if you break it, don't expect me to fix it.  

Support is given to people on Webflake only. Donators of WebFlake get premium support and will receive a reply as soon as I see/receive the message and I'm online. Regulars get standard support and will receive a reply within 1 - 2 business days when I'm online (I'm always busy with patching up some things, or maybe designing new things for Allegro.)

You are not free to upload this theme anywhere else, not even on Webflake without my permission. 


# Branches
The production branch is for ready for release, stable versions of the theme and will be uploaded on Webflake as soon as possible. These can be used perfectly fine on a live website, and if you fancy being first I suggest you to download from GitHub! 

The development branch is for test websites and are not ready yet for release, it contains changes I'm as of uploading satisified with but can be changed at any time. There will be an archive of versions kept in case you are happy with one version.
