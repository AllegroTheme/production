# Allegro | Beautiful and Responsive
By Franceska Mackinson - Version 1.0GRV (GitHub Release Version)

Allegro is a beautiful responsive IPB 4 theme created for Webflake (webflake.sx) and is only officially uploaded to Webflake by the user "Erza", and to the official Allegro GitHub (Allegro Theme). If you see the theme uploaded elsewhere for download or even charged, please do not download those. Allegro is a free theme with clean edits, but requires patches when IPB4 is getting an update because of (necessary) modified theme files that are overwritten during an upgrade. The CSS however is 100% clean and is not overwritten during upgrades. 


# Permissions & Support 
- You are free to modify the theme in custom.css to your liking, but if you break it, don't expect me to fix it.  
- You are not free to upload this theme anywhere else, not even on Webflake without my permission. 
- You are free to modify or remove the "Designed By" bit in your theme. This bit can be found in the footer template.
- You are free to translate the theme and provide me with a translated version. 
(Due to circumstances I am unable to add language strings to the English language, so a few things are plain text in the theme and are not translate-able unless modified manually in the files. So please, do feel free to give me a translated version! Make sure that it is a clean theme, free of modifications made by yourself, though!)

Support is given to people on Webflake only. Donators of WebFlake get premium support and will receive a reply as soon as I see/receive the message and I'm online. Regulars get standard support and will receive a reply within 1 - 2 business days when I'm online (I'm always busy with patching up some things, or maybe designing new things for Allegro.)


# Why Webflake?
I decided to make this theme for Webflake because I'm a member of Weblfake for long and I love the community. There are some really nice people on it, and even though I donate, I want to give more back to Weblfake, but this time - to the users! 


# A little history & Patches!
I made Allegro with a personal use in mind, so my first version was a mess, and was hard coded. Then version 4.0.7 showed up and it allowed me to re-do my theme a bit and fix this up. As of now, the only thing you will need is an updated version of Allegro whenever you want to upgrade your board, because there are files that are overwritten during upgrades to make Allegro look unique!

There are a number type of patches, each are different and each have their own importance. When they're not important enough for a entire new update on Webflake, they most likely end up on GitHub. If they're too minor, they will be included with the next release. New versions will come when they come, new patches come once every two weeks. Upgrade patches come whenever a new version of IPB 4 is released. :) 

- New Version: They are important and can cause your theme to be heavily outdated if you don't upgrade your theme. They can come with a lot of new features, to changing designs, or even removing some old ones to make place for new ones. These don't come often, and don't have a planned timeframe of releases. 
- New Patches: They can contain a few design fixes for flaws I oversaw during the release phase, to a few new features. Big new features can be added here too, but they don't occur as often as with new versions. While it's not super important to upgrade every time whenever a new patch arrives, it is advised or your board theme becomes outdated. 
- Upgrade Patches: They don't add anything new and are just released whenever IPB releases a new version of IPB. You are advised to wait with upgrading your board until a new upgrade patch is released for the new board version. 
- Priority Bug Fix Patch: They are only pushed out when a bug has been found in a theme version that needs to be fixed ASAP or it will cause your theme to become super unstable over time! They are important. 

Want to know when a new patch is available? Keep an eye on the GitHub, or check out the download on Webflake. 


# Branches
The production branch is for ready for release, stable versions of the theme and will be uploaded on Webflake as soon as possible. These can be used perfectly fine on a live website, and if you fancy being first I suggest you to download from GitHub! 

The development branch is for test websites and are not ready yet for release, it contains changes I'm as of uploading satisified with but can be changed at any time. There will be an archive of versions kept in case you are happy with one version.
