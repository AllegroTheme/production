# Allegro | a Beautiful Theme for Invision Power Board 4
By Erza - Version 1.0R | github for development branch 

Allegro is a beautiful responsive IPB 4 theme created for Webflake (webflake.sx) and the ONLY version you should download is from Erza on Webflake. Any other version of Allegro is not supported. At Webflake, users can Private Message me if they have any problems, need the theme again, or if they upgraded their board without waiting for an update of Allegro. Donators of Webflake get premium support (response as soon as I receive the message), normal users receive regular support ( 1 - 2 days ). 
I accept donations as another way of saying thank you, but I appreciate a thank you message, or feedback much more!
